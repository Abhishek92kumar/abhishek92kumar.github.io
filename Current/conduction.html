<p>Press "E" to increase the electric field strength. Notice that the drift velocity increases with the electric field strength (Be patient as it takes a large number of objects to determine the drift velocity accurately!)

<p>Press spacebar to remove the ions. Notice how much faster the electrons move in the absence of the ions. In real life the drift speed is much slower than the time it would take for an electron to move from one charged plate to another. In most cases, humans can walk faster than the electron drift speed in a resistor or a resistive wire.

<p>Notice that as you increase the electric field for the case when the ions have disappeared, you get even faster electron speeds.
